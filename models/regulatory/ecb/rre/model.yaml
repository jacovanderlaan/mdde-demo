  name: RRE (Residential Real Estate) Data Model
  description: |
    ECB Residential Real Estate (RRE) regulation model for mortgage lending data.

    This model extends AnaCredit with additional data requirements specific to
    residential real estate lending, including:
    - Property-level information (location, type, valuation)
    - Borrower characteristics (income, employment status)
    - Loan-to-value ratios
    - Buy-to-let indicators

    The RRE model supports monitoring of systemic risks in the residential
    real estate market and complements the broader AnaCredit framework.
